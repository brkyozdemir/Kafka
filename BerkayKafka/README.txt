

I tried to use Spring Boot, Thymeleaf and MySQL on Java.
- Spring boot, to establish a communication to a browser.
- Thymeleaf, to make a connection between Java and Javascript.
- JDBC, to store the consumed messages locally.


I tried to keep the project as a whole as much as I could do but Docker Image does this job for me, I suppose.
As I said before, I have never used any of them, Docker hub either. So, if it does not work as descripted;

- You need to create a connection on MySQL with username 'root' and password ''. 
- If you use IntelliJ, you need to add MySQL from "Database" tab on the left pane.
- You can check the messages' amount from each city on "localhost:8080".

I hope you will like it!
