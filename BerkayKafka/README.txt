Dear Mr. Berksoz,

First of all, I gladly thank you for an opportunity to work on Kafka platform which I have never used before.
I want to mention that I have never used any of plugin or frameworks in this project except java. 
Also, I am still a senior software engineering student in ï¿½zmir, and I was able to work after 7 pm according to from 9am to 6pm lecture hours each day.
I am sorry for bringing the project this late because we are on midterm weeks stage of this term.
I had a midterm on thursday and going to have 2 more on monday and tuesday.
I realised I made a mistake on creating log files, but it was too late to figure out a solution because of the reason that I mentioned above.(I know this is not an excuse and I am sorry).
The mistake is "creating log files from Kafka Producer" instead of "listening previously created log files from Kafka Producer to Kafka Topic".

I tried to use Spring Boot, Thymeleaf and MySQL on Java.
- Spring boot, to establish a communication to a browser.
- Thymeleaf, to make a connection between Java and Javascript.
- JDBC, to store the consumed messages locally.

At least, I am little bit sure that I understood Kafka platform.
Thank you for this opportunity one more time. 
If my solution has got good feedback. I will ask you to talk.

I tried to keep the project as a whole as much as I could do but Docker Image does this job for me, I suppose.
As I said before, I have never used any of them, Docker hub either. So, if it does not work as descripted;

- You need to create a connection on MySQL with username 'root' and password ''. 
- If you use IntelliJ, you need to add MySQL from "Database" tab on the left pane.
- You can check the messages' amount from each city on "localhost:8080".

I hope you will like it!

Best Regards,
Berkay Ozdemir
